Step into the high-voltage realm of Big Data with me, your guide through the digital frontier of the iGaming industry. With a rich background in B.Sc IT (Hons) Software Development from the University of Malta, I bring over four years of pioneering expertise to the table, weaving magic with Python, C#, Java, and the art of automation. üåå‚ú®

Armed with a toolkit of the latest technologies like Jupyter, NIFI, Kafka, Debezium, and Airbyte, my quest is to turn the tangle of data into actionable insights. I'm also a connoisseur of database technologies, including Clickhouse and PostgreSQL, and a narrative architect, employing Streamlit and Metabase to tell compelling data stories. üìòüí´

One of my signature achievements is the development of the GiG Broker CRM data pipeline, a revolutionary project that elevated real-time customer profiling in CRM platforms such as Symplify, showcasing my leadership in transformative projects. üöÄüåü

I am a futurist in the field of data engineering, driven by the desire to uncover insights that power decision-making and foster community collaboration. My aim is to spark connections and innovations that propel our industry forward. üîóüí°
